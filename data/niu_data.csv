Standing in the Bayer Estate are twelve of the original thirty-two coconut trees germinated from coconuts from the island of Niʻihau. According to Bayer's family, these coconut trees were a gift of Carlos Long, given in 1930 from the Robinson family who own the Island of Niʻihau. One of the unique characteristics of this particular niu variety I detected is that the unevenly positioned nature of the spikelet in the inflorescence would allow female flowers to be receptive in different phases for a longer period over 4 weeks. During this period, female flows would be able to receive pollen directly and indirectly from male pollen available from 3 different inflorescences within any given time on the same tree.","Compact Dwarf","Yes","Medium","Circular","Green","14.0","F","Medium","Spherical","Autogamy (D, I)",NA
